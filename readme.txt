Project Benevolent God is a lightweight script for calculating the grades for any given test based on the provided maximum points value
of the test and the scale on which the points are to be distributed.

Currently working features:
- Grade scale calculation
- Switching between 2 different scales

Planned/WIP features:
- multiple scales to switch between instead of just 2
- a way to add X additional scales
    - an easy way to create such a scale using a GUI
- the possibility to display multiple result GradeScale popup windows at once (e.g. for SpecEd student grading vs standard grading)
